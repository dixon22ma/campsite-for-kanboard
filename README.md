# campsite-for-kanboard

An Basecamp-inspired css-only themes for Kanboard. Extremely small size.
Many thanks to CSS Milligram UI, milligram.io and Basecamp for their inspriation.
Font in use: Valera round Regular (from Google font)
## INSTALLATION
Unzip the whole thing into your plugin folder
That's it.
Edit the skin.css file to start theming. :)

## Theming objectives:

1. Only use CSS, minimal disruption to the code.
2. A modern card-based theme
3. Simple (I like simplicity, but kinda dislike minimalism)
4. Informal & Fun (If you are adding overhead to other people's work, you gotta make it Fun and Enjoyable)

### Pros:
1. Fun to theme
2. Learning by doing CSS
3. Improve UX of kanboard (ofc)

### Cons:
1. I'm doing this for fun, so my coding style is quick and (extremely) dirty
2. Change in nameing style could break the whole thing.

### A few useful UX tips (for me)
1. Out of sight, out of mind
2. Do not suprise users
3. People generally HATE to fill in forms.
4. You add more...

## Logic from user's point of view - to improve theme
1. Kanboard is project oriented (duh?)
2. Users click links/menu/navi -> expecting page reload and take them to somewhere
3. Users click buttons -> expecting something to happen
4. Users click tabs -> expecting page layout to stay the same, only the tab content change
5. Card should provide a few (3) information, not a lot. (this is subjective)
